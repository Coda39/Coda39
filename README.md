## 🔥 Featured Projects

### 🖥️ MJFOX Freezing of Gait Predictor
This project aims to detect and predict Freezing of Gait (FOG) episodes in Parkinson's disease patients using machine learning models trained on data from wearable movement sensors. It builds on previous research studies to identify these debilitating "freezing" moments where patients temporarily lose the ability to walk, combining accelerometer sensor data from a patient's back and legs with advanced deep learning techniques to detect these episodes accurate
